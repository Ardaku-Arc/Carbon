The terminal app for ArcOS
The actual windowed app, e.g. Konsole and CMD. There is a built in kernel terminal called "KTerm" which is a very basic version of this
Maybe its possible to use KTerm for some rendering or something or reuse some code
IDK, I think it makes sense to render KTerm inside the window (vulkan) and tell the Display API to change the colors or something
The display api then uses the display drivers, makes more complex use of it compared to KTerm.
