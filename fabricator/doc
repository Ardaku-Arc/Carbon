## Purpose
An SDK/framework to build apps on ArcOS
Uses NeutronWM libraries to create windows. Then uses its own libraries, images, animations, functions for everything else.
Includes a cross platform IDE that allows one to build a native desktop app for ArcOS easily.
Benefits of native apps:
- speed
- security, completely decoupled from the web and any web technologies, e.g. compared to a web app or electron app
- robustness, the code is completely managed by you and only relies on the WM/kernel libraries. Wont randomly break like libraries on the web
